Great job, Devean!

Code very formatted and very easy to read.

Details:
Line 40: This does not take in account of the quantity
Line 104: This assumes names contain only first and last
Line 150: Good calling out at least one word character
Line 192: Good checking against decimals
Line 194: word would have only one digit
Line 329: This pattern will capture $1,1.22 as well
